# .gov Affiliated GitHub Organizations

This directory contains a hand curation of `.gov` affiliated GitHub
organizations. These files are maintained by hand due to a lack of any sort of
registry of GitHub organizations.

This list was inspired by the [GitHub Government
community's](https://government.github.com/community/) curated list of [GitHub
organization affiliations](https://government.github.com/organizations.json).

## TODO Ideas

- Tie in to the new abiltiy for GitHub to "Verify" an organization by proving
  that the org controls the domain associated with it (see the [LLNL
  organization for an example](https://github.com/llnl).
