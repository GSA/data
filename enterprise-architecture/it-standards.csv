After it is propagated to the clients and the new values become active, all the client reports containing non-ASCII characters are displayed correctly on the BigFix console, even if the reports come from clients with code pages different from the BigFix server code page.The BigFix console, even if installed on a system with a local code page different from the BigFix server code page, can connect to the server and display correctly.
